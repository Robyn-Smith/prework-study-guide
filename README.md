# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>


## Description

As a bootcamp student, and a beginner in coding, I wanted to make a guide that supports my learning of HTML, Git, CSS and JavaScript. The guide includes definitions of each type of code and some useful tips on how to use them. This guide also allowed me to practise the skills I have learnt. This website makes it much easier to display and see my notes rather than searching through hand written notes or screenshots as all necessary information is stored in one place; it is quick and easy to read. I will continue to add my notes to this guide as I progress on this course and refer back to them. During this project I learnt how to write code, save files and debug issues.

## Usage

Each section of this website contains a list of notes on the topics HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. If you right click on the website and click inspect this will open the DevTools console. When the DevTools console is open you can see that Javascript has been used to suggest a topic to study at random.
